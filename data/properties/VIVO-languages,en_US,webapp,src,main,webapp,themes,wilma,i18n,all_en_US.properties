grants_text_one=This body is from the the template file vivo/productMods/templates/freemarker/body/menupage/grants.ftl.  In the display model, the grants page has a display:requiresBodyTemplate property that defines that the grants page overrides the default template. The default template for these pages is at /vitro/webapp/web/templates/freemarker/body/menupage/menupage.ftl
grants_text_three=This would create a page that would use about.ftl as the body.  The page would be accessed via /about and would override all servlet mappings in web.xml.
grants_two=This technique could be used to define pages without menu items, that get their content from a freemarker template.  An example would be the about page.
